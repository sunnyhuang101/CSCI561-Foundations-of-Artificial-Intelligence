### Search
Implemented following search algorithms to find the optimal path for a given topological map:<br>
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)<br>
- Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)<br>
- A* Search (A*)<br>


### Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning in Game Playing
Implemented Minimax Algorithm to build a Halma game playing agent to predict an legal and most efficient move. Optimized by using Alpha Beta Pruning to reduce depth of search and avoid redundant moves in limited time.


### First Order Logic
Implemented Resolution Algorithm to build a logical agent for First Order Logic Inference, given a Knowledge Base.
